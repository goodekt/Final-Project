        <p>
          As a part of the UC rocketry club I desgined a L1 rocket from scratch with the guidence of my mentor Landry Danielson. I used a I-161 moter and it went apporximatly 2500 feet in the air. It used a single shoot deploy system and a statologer for the computer. I also had to design parts for the electronics bay via <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr>.

            My team and I had to pick a population and find something that they needed and then solve that problem. We chose a population in Etheopia. We then stepped through the engineering process to solve thier money and food struggle. We made a system that could produce food and fertilizer that they can eat and sell. The system would start as by putting human waste and plant waste into an Anaerobic Digester then that would break down into a fertlizer. We would attach the fertalizer to a hydroponics system which would produce plants to eat. Then the plant waste would get recycled into the digester.

            My team and I were given a problem which was to help the people affected by hurricanes clean up and dispose of trash. To replicate this we were given a lego mindstorm kit and had to build and code a robot that could follow a solid and dotted path. Once the robot came across a trash bin it had to determine what the material was by weight and then take it to the unloading site.

            A team and I were given a task to pick an item that had complex parts and we had to reverse engineer it and then divide the parts up to design them using Siemens NX. My team and I chose a coffee grinder.
